\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes \textit{ScalIMS}, a NFV management system designed to deploy and scale service chains spanning geo-distributed datacenters, using the case of an IMS. \textit{ScalIMS} features joint proactive and reactive scaling of DP and CP service chains, for timely and cost-effective provisioning of practical network services. Evaluation of our prototype implementation on IBM SoftLayer cloud shows that: (i) \textit{ScalIMS} improves QoS of user traffic by a large margin when compared with pure reactive scaling; (ii) when peak workload arrives asynchronously over the geographic span, \textit{ScalIMS} effectively reduces the total number of VNF instances provisioned while guaranteeing excellent QoS. %\textit{Finally}, we show that distributed routing framework of \textit{ScalIMS} accurately route flows across geo-distributed datacenters.
