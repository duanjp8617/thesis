\section{Sumary}

This chapter proposes \netstar, the first attempt to bring the future/promise abstraction to the NF dataplane for flow processing.  \netstar~adopts a dual-stack approach, enabling it to implement NFs processing packets at different layers. To fully utilize the power of future/promise, we carefully design an async-flow interface that chains a number of future/promise and continuation functions for efficiently handling a series of asynchronous operations. Using \netstar, asynchronous programming in NFs is made easy, elegant, while good packet processing performance is still guaranteed. Our extensive evaluation shows that \netstar~can effectively simplify asynchronous programming asynchronous in NFs, while easily achieve line-rate packet processing for NFs.
