Over the past years, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) becomes an important research topic. NFV technology advocates replacing hardware network functions (NFs) with virtualized NFs running on standard virtualization platform, which can significantly reduce the deployment cost and management complexity of NFs.

Despite of the advantages, there has been several problems that bother the practitioners of NFV technology. First, some network services are preferred to be deployed across geo-distributed datacenters so that users can enjoy better service quality. However, existing NFV management systems suffer poor scalability when deploying NFV service chains across geo-distributed datacenters, as scaling across multiple datacenters requires non-trivial interactions between various components of an NFV management system. Second, resilience functionality, including failure resilience and flow migration, is of pivotal importance in NFV system. But existing NFV systems implementing resilience functionalities usually have unsatisfactory performance due to heavyweight check-pointing and centralized control. Finally, some NFs need to contact external services to achieve advanced functionalities. For the best performance, these NFs are usually implemented using callback-based asynchronous programming method, which is complex and error-prone. Moreover, the increased implementation complexity brought by callbacks further limits the development of better NF software.

Regarding the three problems, this thesis proposes three resulting systems, including \textit{ScalIMS}, \nfactor~and \netstar, to tackle these problems in a systematic way.

\textit{ScalIMS} designs a dynamic NFV service chain scaling system that is capable of scaling NFV service chains across geo-distributed datacenters, using IMS system as a case study. \textit{ScalIMS} combines proactive and reactive approaches for timely, cost-effective scaling of the service chains, and is evaluated on a geo-distributed public cloud. The evaluation result reveals that \textit{ScalIMS} can effectively scale multiple NFV service chains across geo-distributed datacenters for improved traffic quality and reduced resource consumption.

\nfactor~is a novel NFV system that aims to provide lightweight failure resilience and high-performance flow migration by leveraging actor model to improve the parallelism of resilience functionalities, while the efficiency of the actor model is guaranteed by a carefully designed runtime system. Moreover, \nfactor~achieves transparent resilience: once a new NF is implemented for~\nfactor, the NF automatically acquires resilience support. The evaluation result shows that~\nfactor~achieves 10Gbps packet processing, flow migration completion time that is 144 times faster than existing system, and packet processing delay stablized at around 20 microseconds during replication.

\netstar~is a new NF programming framework that brings the future/promise abstraction to the NF dataplane. \netstar~simplifies asynchronous NF programming via a carefully designed async-flow interface that exploits the future/promise paradigm by chaining multiple continuation functions for asynchronous operation handling. NF programs implemented using \netstar~framework mimic simple synchronous programs, but are able to achieve full flow processing asynchrony with good performance. The evaluation result demonstrates that \netstar~can effectively simplify asynchronous NF programming by substantially reducing the required lines of code, while still approaching line-rate packet processing speeds.

First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my supervisor, Prof. Chuan Wu, for her kind help throughout the course of my graduate study. She has been encouraging and motivating me to pursue my own research goal and I really appreciate all the precious discussions that we had during the past five years. Besides research, Prof. Chuan Wu also helped me get through so many obstacles that I had in life. Without Prof. Chuan Wu's kind help, I wouldn't have completed my graduate study.

Second, I would like to thank Dr. Heming Cui for his kind help and discussions on the project that we worked together. Dr. Heming Cui's passion for solving challenging research problems really motivates me to keep on improving the quality of my research work.

I would like to thank various group members who I have worked with: Dr. Yu Wu, Dr. Jian Zhao, Dr. Xuanjia Qiu, Zhizhong Zhang, Xiaoxi Zhang, Yanghua Peng, Yixin Bao, Qihang Sun, Xiaodong Yi, Junjie Wang and many others. This journey would not be so memorable without all the support and help from all of them. I would also like to thank my collaborators including Dr. Franck Le and Prof. Alex X. Liu, for their important discussions that make my research work better.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents for raising me and giving me power to complete my graduate study. I would like to thank my fiance, Bingjie Zhao, for all the love that she gave me.

The entire thesis is dedicated to my dearest mother.
